basic styling 
{

    defensive coding, define some styles both on the tag and in the header 

    style everything on the table cell (most reliable style rendering)
    use spans for overrides if necessary

    possibly use grunt to generate inline styles?

    gmail app and samsung email app strip style block

    define line heights in pixels (4px more than font size for body styles)

    styled alt text (style element on the img tag will affect the way the alt text is rendered when images are blocked)

    buttons: [
        VML { 
            MS-specific language
        },
        border {
            put the styles on the anchor tag
        },
        padding {
            table, cell, alignment, css3 rounded corners, padding on cell, bgcolor (only text is clickable)
        }]
}
