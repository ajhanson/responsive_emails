basic styling 
{

    defensive coding, define some styles both on the tag and in the header 
    
    email clients are much less forgiving of syntax errors/unclosed tags, etc.

    style everything on the table cell (most reliable style rendering)
    use spans for overrides if necessary

    possibly use grunt to generate inline styles?

    gmail app and samsung email app strip style block

    define line heights in pixels (4px more than font size for body styles)

    styled alt text (style element on the img tag will affect the way the alt text is rendered when images are blocked)

    buttons: [
        VML { 
            MS-specific language
        },
        border {
            put the styles on the anchor tag
        },
        padding {
            table, cell, alignment, css3 rounded corners, padding on cell, bgcolor (only text is clickable)
        }]
}

deeper {
    media queries
    {
        support varies per device/app/OS
        samsung kitkat doesn't support in native app
        
        use attribute selectors (img[class="logo"], deals with a yahoo app bug)
        
        !important overrides inline styles
        
        iphones will increase font sizes to 13px if they are defined lower
        (override included in template)
    }
    
    adding responsive behavior
    {
        emails are generally desktop first, then mobile
        -- or -- 
        the media queries are primarily meant for mobile clients
        
        fluid images
        add class="fluid-image" to img tag
    }
}
