God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. The light is your friend. Preserve it. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.

Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let the paint work. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
